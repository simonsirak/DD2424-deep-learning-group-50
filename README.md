# PSPNet Implementation in Tensorflow
This repository contains an implementation of [PSPNet](https://hszhao.github.io/projects/pspnet/) in Tensorflow 2.1, as part of a project for DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

*The code was written in a pair-programming fashion using screensharing on Discord. As such, all project members contributed to most of the commits.*
